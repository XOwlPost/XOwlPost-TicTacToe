# XOwlPost-TicTacToe is a web-based application that allows users to play the game of TicTacToe against each other, place bets on the outcome of the game, and win unique NFT badges for winning with a bet of at least 2 ether. The game is powered by a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum network and offers users the ability to video call their opponent during a game if their bet is above 2 ether. The application also includes a leaderboard system to keep track of the top players and a chat function powered by SendBird. The repository for the project contains the source code for the smart contract and the front-end user interface, as well as deployment scripts and instructions for running the application locally.
